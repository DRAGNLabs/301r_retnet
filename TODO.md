- clean up code in train model lightning
- ensure that logging is working as we want it to, that we're logging the right things, and that we can see the tensorboard logs. Look into torch lightning logging
- fix line 401 in train_model_lightning: for gridsearch currently, we need to return the loss, not sure if we're returning the right thing.
- Make sure it works with gridsearch? Or, determine if we are ever going to use gridsearch again
- Implement LR scheduler in train_model
- Test run a couple models on a larger dataset, to make sure everything is working correctly
